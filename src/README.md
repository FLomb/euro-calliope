# Building Euro Calliope

The files in this subfolder can create Euro Calliope. This subfolder is important to you if you want to manipulate Euro Calliope itself. It is not important when you intend to _use_ Euro Calliope.

## Getting ready

You need [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) to build the model. Using conda, you can create a conda environment from within you can run the build steps:

    conda env create -f conda-environment.yml

Don't forget to activate the environment.
